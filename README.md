# Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment

This project contains the first data mining of the data in Kaggle competition: [Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment). 

The documents here contains An EDA of the dataset, the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) of the text documents and an initial word2vec modeling of the data. The main improvements addressed on the data cleaning process.

The project is still in developing far from completion. The implementations by myself are those ipython notebook documents and the utils.py file in lib folder.
