# Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment

This project contains the first data mining of the data in Kaggle competition: [Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment). 

The documents here contains An Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset, the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) of the text documents and an initial word2vec modeling of the data. The main contributions are addressed on the data cleaning process.

The project is still in developing and far from completion. The implementations by myself are those ipython notebook documents (.ipynb) and the utils.py file in lib folder.
